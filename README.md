# phoneticRoadMaps

This repository stores a set of scripts in R and Praat used for the forced-alignment, processing, and visualisation of phontic data.

The focus is on processes carried out for minority and endangered languages, which can be related to languages with small amount of data.

The scripts have been organised in sequential order, which is the recommended structure:

0_CreatePraatFormatFiles.praat

1_GetTranscriptionFiles.R

2_CreatePronDictionary.R

3_CreateTextGrids.R

4_FA_runningthe Aligner.txt

5_AddPhonologicalInformation.r

6_getPitchAndIntensity.praat

7_dynamicWrangler.R

8_mergeWithPraatValues.R

9_NormaliseFormants.R

10_PlotVowels.R

The Pronunciation dictionary is also available in the file: nanasu_dict.txt

The first three entries are:

a	a

abita	a b i t a

aeregh	a e r e g h
