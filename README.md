# phoneticRoadMaps

This repository stores a set of scripts in R and Praat used for the forced-alignment, processing, and visualisation of phontic data.

The focus is on processes carried out for minority and endangered languages.

The scripts have been organised in sequential order, which is the recommended structure:

0_CreatePraatFormatFiles.praat

1_GetTranscriptionFiles.R

2_CreatePronDictionary.R

3_CreateTextGrids.R

4_FA_runningthe Aligner.txt

5_AddPhonologicalInformation.r

6_getPitchAndIntensity.praat

7_dynamicWrangler.R

8_mergeWithPraatValues.R

9_NormaliseFormants.R

10_PlotVowels.R

The Pronunciation dictionary is also available in the file: nanasu_dict.txt
